# Audio Streaming Web App

A real-time audio streaming application that allows users to broadcast live audio and listeners to join and hear the stream in real-time.

## Features

- **Live Audio Broadcasting**: Stream microphone audio in real-time
- **Broadcaster Authentication**: Password protection for broadcasting access
- **Multiple Listeners**: Support for multiple simultaneous listeners (no authentication required)
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based communication for low latency
- **Audio Visualization**: Visual feedback for audio activity
- **Volume Control**: Adjustable volume for listeners
- **Connection Status**: Real-time connection and broadcasting status
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

1. **Broadcaster**: Must authenticate with password, then can stream microphone audio
2. **Server**: Relays audio data from authenticated broadcaster to all connected listeners
3. **Listeners**: Can join freely without authentication to listen to the live audio stream
4. **WebSockets**: Enable real-time bidirectional communication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- A modern web browser with microphone support
- For public access: ngrok (optional, for sharing outside your network)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   - Main page: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Broadcaster: `http://localhost:3000/broadcast`
   - Listener: `http://localhost:3000/listen`

### Using with ngrok (Public Access)

To share your audio stream with people outside your local network:

1. **Install ngrok** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   brew install ngrok
   # or download from https://ngrok.com/download
   ```

2. **Quick setup with custom domain**:
   ```bash
   ./setup-ngrok.sh
   ```

3. **Manual setup**:
   ```bash
   # Start your local server
   npm start
   
   # In another terminal, start ngrok
   ngrok http --domain=audiocast.ngrok.io 3000
   ```

4. **Access your app**:
   - Broadcaster: `https://audiocast.ngrok.io/broadcast`
   - Listeners: `https://audiocast.ngrok.io/listen`
   - Share the listener URL with your audience!

### Development

For development with auto-restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

### For Broadcasters

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/broadcast` (or `https://audiocast.ngrok.io/broadcast`)
2. Enter the broadcaster password (default: `broadcast123`)
3. Click "Start Broadcasting"
4. Allow microphone access when prompted
5. Share the listener URL with your audience
6. Monitor listener count in real-time

### For Listeners

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/listen` (or `https://audiocast.ngrok.io/listen`)
2. Click "Join Stream" (no password required)
3. Adjust volume as needed
4. Enjoy the live audio stream!

## Technical Details

### Audio Format
- Uses WebM container with Opus codec for efficient compression
- 100ms chunks for low latency
- Automatic audio enhancements (echo cancellation, noise suppression)

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and WebSocket (ws library)
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket for audio data and control messages
- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API for recording and playback

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 66+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Configuration

The server runs on port 3000 by default. You can change this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

## Security Considerations

- **HTTPS Required**: Modern browsers require HTTPS for microphone access
- **Origin Validation**: Consider implementing origin validation for production
- **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting for WebSocket connections
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication for private broadcasts

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Access Issues
- Ensure you're using HTTPS in production
- Check browser permissions for microphone access
- Try refreshing the page and allowing permissions again

### Audio Quality Issues
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure other applications aren't using the microphone
- Try closing other browser tabs that might be using audio

### Connection Issues
- Verify the server is running
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure WebSocket connections are allowed
